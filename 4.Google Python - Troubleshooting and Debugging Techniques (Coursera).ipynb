  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "- Understanding Slowness\n",
    "\n",
    "The general strategy for addressing slowness is to identify the  **bottleneck** for addressing slowness in our device, our script, or our system to run slowly. The bottleneck could be the CPU time as we just mentioned. But it could also be time spent reading data from disk waiting for data transmitted over the network, moving data from disk to RAM, or some other resource that's limiting the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - When an application is accessing some data, the time spent retrieving that data will depend on where it's located. \n",
    "    - If it's a variable that's currently being used in a function, the data will be in the CPU's internal memory, and our program will retrieve it really fast. \n",
    "    - If the data is related to a running program but maybe not the currently executing function, it will likely be in RAM, and our program will still get to a pretty fast. \n",
    "    - If the data is in a file, our program will need to read it from disk, which is much slower than reading it from RAM, and \n",
    "    - worse than reading from disk, is reading information from over the network. In this case, we have a lower transmission speed, and we also need to establish the connection to the other endpoint to make the transmission possible, which adds to the total time needed to get to the data. \n",
    "    - if you repeatedly reading files from disk, you might see if you can put the same information directly into the process memory and avoid loading it from disk every time. \n",
    "    - In other words, you want to consider if you can create a cache, **a cache** stores data in a form that's faster to access than its original form.\n",
    " \n",
    " - There's a ton of examples of caches in IT. \n",
    "     - A web proxy is a form of cash. It stores websites, images, or videos that are accessed often by users behind the proxy. So they don't need to be downloaded from the Internet every time. \n",
    "     - DNS services usually implement a local cache for the websites they resolve. So they don't need to query from the Internet every time someone asks for their IP address. \n",
    "     - The operating system also takes care of some caching for us. It tries to keep as much information as possible in RAM so that we can access it fast. This includes the contents of files or libraries that are accessed often, even if they aren't in use right now. We say that these contents are cached in memory. We call that that if the data is part of a program that's currently running, it will be in RAM. But RAM is limited. If you run enough programs at the same time, you'll fill it up and run out of space. What happens when you run out of RAM? At first, the OS will just remove from RAM anything that's cached, but not strictly necessary. \n",
    "     - If there's still not enough RAM after that, the operating system will put the parts of the memory that aren't currently in use onto the hard drive in a space called **swap**. The information that's not needed right now is removed from RAM and put onto the disk, while the information that's needed now is put into RAM. \n",
    "         - This is normal operation, and most of the time, we don't notice it. But if the available memory is significantly less than what the running applications need, the OS will have to keep swapping out the data that's not in use right now to move the data currently in use to RAM, and as we called out, our computer can switch between applications very quickly, which means that the data currently in use can also change very quickly. The computer will start spending a lot of time writing to disc to make some space in RAM and then reading from disk to put other things in RAM. This can be super slow. \n",
    "             - So what do you do if you find that your machine is slow because it's spending a lot of time swapping? There are basically three possible reasons for this. We've already talked about two of them. \n",
    "                 - First, if there are too many open applications and some can be closed, close the ones that aren't needed. \n",
    "                 - Or if the available memory is just too small for the amount that computer is using, add more RAM to the computer. \n",
    "                 - The third reason is that one of the running programs may have a memory leak, causing it to take all the available memory. **A memory leak** means that memory which is no longer needed is not getting released.  For now, let's just say that if a program is using a lot of memory and this stops when you restart the program, it's probably because of a memory leak. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What's making a computer slow**\n",
    "\n",
    "So when trying to figure out what's making a computer slow, the first step is to look into when the computer is slow. If it's slow when starting up, it's probably a sign that there are too many applications configured to start on boot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we want our code to finish faster, we need to make our computer do less work, and to do this, we'll have to avoid doing work that isn't really needed. How? \n",
    "    - The most common ones include storing data that was already calculated to avoid calculating it again using the right data structures for the problem and reorganizing the code so that the computer can stay busy while waiting for information from slow sources like disk or over the network. \n",
    "    - To know what sources of slowness we need to address, we have to figure out where our code is spending most of its time. There's a bunch of tools that can help us with that called profilers. \n",
    "        - **A profiler** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)) is a tool that measures the resources that our code is using, giving us a better understanding of what's going on. \n",
    "        - Because of how profilers work, they are specific to each programming language. \n",
    "            - So we would use gprof to analyze a C program but use the c-Profile module to analyze a Python program. \n",
    "            - Using tools like these, we can see which functions are called by our program, how many times each function was called and how much time are programs spent on each of them. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "- **Lists** are sequences of elements. \n",
    "    - We can add, remove, or modify the elements in them. \n",
    "    - We can iterate through the whole list to operate on each of the elements. \n",
    "        - Different programming languages call them differently. \n",
    "            - The structure is called ArrayList in Java, \n",
    "            - Vector in C++, \n",
    "            - Array in Ruby, and \n",
    "            - Slice in Go. \n",
    "            - All these names refer to the same data structure that's fast to add or remove elements at the end. \n",
    "         - But adding or removing elements in the middle can be slow because all the elements that follow need to be repositioned. \n",
    "         - It's fast to access the element in a specific position in the list, but finding an element in an unknown position requires going through the whole list. \n",
    "         - This can be super slow if the list is long. \n",
    " \n",
    "- **Dictionary** store key value pairs. \n",
    "    - We add data by associating a value to a key. \n",
    "    - Then, we retrieve a value by looking up a specific key. \n",
    "        - They are called;\n",
    "        - HashMap in Java, Unordered Map in C++, Hash in Ruby, and Map in Go. \n",
    "        - The map part in those names comes from how we're creating a mapping between a key and a value. \n",
    "        - The Hash part comes from the fact that to make the structure efficient, a hashing function is used internally to decide how the elements will be stored. \n",
    "        - The main characteristic of this structure is that it's super-fast for looking up keys. \n",
    "        - Once we have our data stored in a dictionary, we can find the value associated to a key in just one operation. \n",
    "            - If it were stored in a list, we need to iterate through the list.\n",
    "            \n",
    "- So as a rule of thumb, \n",
    "    - if you need to access elements by position or will always iterate through all the elements, use a list to store them. \n",
    "        - This could be a list of all computers in the network, of all employees in the company, or of all products currently on sale for example. \n",
    "    - On the flip side, if we need to look up the elements using a key, we'll use a dictionary. \n",
    "        - This could be the data associated to a user which we'd look up using their username, the IP associated to a computer using the host name, or the data associated to a product using the internal product code. \n",
    "    - Whenever we need to do a bunch of these lookup operations, creating a dictionary and using it to get the data will take a lot less time than iterating over a list to find what we're looking for. \n",
    "    - But it doesn't make sense to create a dictionary and fill it with data if we're only going to look up one value in it. \n",
    "        - In that case, we're wasting time creating the structure when we could just iterate over the list and get the element we're looking for. \n",
    "    - Another thing that we might want to think twice about is creating copies of the structures that we have in memory. \n",
    "        - If these structures are big, it can be pretty expensive to create those copies. \n",
    "        - So we should double-check if the copy is really needed. \n",
    "            \n",
    "Whenever you have a loop in your code, make sure to check what actions you're doing, and see if there are operations you can take out of the loop to do them just once. Instead of making one network call for each element, make one call before the loop. Instead of reading from disk for each element, read the whole thing before the loop. Even if the operations done inside the loop aren't especially expensive, if we're going through a list of a thousand elements and we only need five out of them, we're wasting time on elements we don't need. Make sure that the list of elements that you're iterating through is only as long as you really need it to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Threads**\n",
    "and sometimes we might need to have some shared data. In that case, we'd use threads. Threads let us run parallel tasks inside a process. This allows Threads to share some of the memory with other threads in the same process. \n",

    "Each process running on our computer asks the operating system for a chunk of memory. This is the memory used to store values and do operations on them during the program's execution. The OS keeps a mapping table of which process is assigned which portion of the memory. Processes aren't allowed to read or write outside of the portions of memory they were assigned. So **accessing invalid memory** means that the process tried to access a portion of the system's memory that wasn't assigned to it. \n",

This way, you can make sure the program doesn't crash and leave your users frustrated. \n",

    "    - Memory Leaks:  A memory leak, happens when a chunk of memory that's no longer needed is not released.\n",
    "         - You might be thinking why should I care if I don't plan to code in C or C plus plus, it's true, the languages like Python, Java, or Go manage memory for us, but things can still go wrong if we don't use the memory correctly. \n",
    "         - To understand how this works, let's look into what these languages do. \n",
    "             - First, they request the necessary memory when we create variables, and then \n",
    "             - they run a tool called Garbage collector, that's in charge of freeing the memory that's no longer in use.\n",
    "             - To detect when that's the case, the garbage collector looks at the variables in use and the memory assigned to them and then checks if there any portions of the memory that aren't being referenced by any variables. \n",
    "                 - Say for example, you create a dictionary inside a function, use it to process a text file, calculate the frequency of the words in the file, and then return the word that was used the most frequently. \n",
    "                 - When the function returns, the dictionary is not referenced anymore. \n",
    "                 - So the garbage collector can detect this and give back the unused memory, but \n",
    "                 - if the function returns the whole dictionary, then it's still in use, and the memory won't be given back until that stops being the case. \n",
    "              - When our code keeps variables pointing to the data in memory, like a variable in the code itself, or an element in a list or a dictionary, the garbage collector won't release that memory. \n",
    "              - In other words, even when the language takes care of requesting and releasing the memory for us, we could still see the same effects of a memory leak.\n",
    "              \n",
    "              - So let's jog its memory, what can we do if we suspect a program has a memory leak? \n",
    "              - We can use a memory profiler to figure out how the memory is being used. \n",
    "              - As what debuggers will have to use the right profiler for the language of the application. \n",
    "              - For profiling C and C plus plus programs, we'll use Valgrind which we mentioned in an earlier video.\n",
    "              - For profiling a Python, there are bunch of different tools that are disposal, depending on what exactly we want to profile. \n",
    "              - We can be as detailed as profiling the memory usage of a single function, or as big picture as monitoring the total memory consumption over time. \n",
    "              - Using profilers, we can see what structures are using the most memory at one in time or take snapshots at different points in time and compare them. \n",
    "              - The goal of these tools is to help us identify which information we're keeping in memory that we don't actually need. \n",
    "              - It's important that we measure the use of memory first before we try to change anything, otherwise we might be optimizing the wrong piece of code. \n",
    "       - If some applications are using so much bandwidth that others can't transmit anymore data, it's possible to restrict how much each connection takes by using **traffic shaping**. This is a way of marking the data packets sent over the network with different priorities. To avoid having huge chunks of data, use all the bandwidth. \n",
    "           - By prioritizing accordingly, processes that send and receive small packets can keep working fine, while processes that need the most bandwidth can use the rest.\n",

    "    - But let's cover the basic structure that can help us get organized and prioritize our tasks. \n",
    "    - The first step is to make a list of all of the tasks that need to get done.\n",
    "        - You can make this list on a piece of paper, a text file in your computer, a bug tracking system, or a ticket management system. Whatever works for you. \n",
    "            - The point is to have all the tasks listed in one place to avoid depending on your not always perfect memory later. \n",
    "     - Once you have the list, you can check the real urgency of the tasks. \n",
    "         - Ask yourself, if any items don't get done today will something bad happen? If yes, then those should be worked on first. Once you're done with the most critically urgent tasks, you can look at the rest of the list and assess the importance of each issue.\n",
    "    - Even when it looks like everything is important, you should be able to tell that some things are more important than others. \n",
    "        - For example, a task that will benefit more people is more important than a task that will benefit less people. \n",
    "        - If there are a bunch of different tasks that depend on you completing one, that roadblock is more important to clear than the rest. \n",
    "    - If it still seems like everything is on fire, you can try dividing the tasks into groups of most important, important, and not so important. \n",
    "    - And then sort the tasks inside each group, but don't spend too much time doing this sorting. \n",
    "    - In the end, the exact order isn't what matters. What matters is that you spend most of your time working on the most important tasks. \n",
    "    - And if you work with a team of people, it's a good idea to share both the list of tasks and the standard of prioritization among team members. This helps you avoid having to do the work multiple times and coming out with different priorities. \n",
    "    - Once you have a list of the most important tasks to work on, you'll want to have a rough idea of how much effort they'll take.\n",
    "        - This isn't about exact timing, it's about assigning rough sizes. One common technique is to use small, medium, and large. And when the range of sizes is big enough, include extra small or extra large if needed. \n",
    "    - Once you identify the most important tasks and how big they are, you can start working on them. \n",
    "        - If possible, try to start with the larger, most important tasks to get those out of the way first. \n",
    "        - But as we called out, when our work involves IT support, we know that we'll have to deal with interruptions. And working on complex tasks while getting interrupted can be very frustrating. I hear that. \n",
    "        - One strategy that can help us with that is saving the most complex tasks for the moments when we're less likely to get interrupted. If you know that you get busiest in the morning, and you tend to have more quiet time during the afternoon, it makes sense to work on easy and quick tasks early in the day. \n",
    "       - Save the most complex tasks for later, when you'll have more time to concentrate on them. \n",
    "       - But when your focused time starts, you should make sure that you work on those large complex tasks and not on the easy ones. Otherwise, the complex tasks will never get done. The key here is to always work on important tasks. \n",
    "       - **If a task is not important, it shouldn't be done at all. Really, we live by this rule here at Google.**\n",
    "       \n",
    "    - Then select which task you're going to deal with depending on urgency and how much time you can devote to it, starting with the biggest tasks that you can fit in the time you have available. \n",
    "        - But keep in mind, this shouldn't stop you from taking a break or working on experimental projects.\n",
    "        - Did you know that this very certificate program got its start as a side project at Google? \n",
    "   - Okay, but what if the unthinkable happens? What can we do if after all of this prioritizing, sizing, and ordering there's just too much work to be done and too few hours in the day?\n",
    "       - Which means there are basically two options, either you get extra help from other team members or you decide that some tasks weren't really that important, and they won't get done. \n",
    "       - For both of these options, you'll need to involve other people, like your manager, and make sure **that expectations get clearly communicated.**"
